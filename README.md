# HeadTails: Coin Flip Simulator

## Introduction

HeadTails is a command-line application written in C# that simulates the flipping of a coin. This project aims to provide a simple yet engaging way to practice basic C# programming concepts, including random number generation and user input handling.

## Features

* Simulate the flipping of a coin with a random result (Head or Tails).
* User-friendly command-line interface (CLI).
* Allows the user to flip the coin multiple times in a single session.

To run this project, you'll need .NET SDK installed.

## Project Structure
The project consists of the following file:
* **Program.cs**: Contains the main program logic and user interaction.

## Instructions

1. Clone this repository:

```sh
https://github.com/Angcroft/HeadTails.git
```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

```sh
cd HeadTails
```

3. Build and run the project:

```sh
dotnet run
```

## How it works

When you run the program, you'll be presented with a simple interface that allows you to flip a coin and see the result.

### Main Menu Options
1. Flip the coin
2. Exit the program

### Flip the Coin

Each time you choose to flip the coin, the program will randomly display "Head" or "Tails". You can continue flipping the coin as many times as you like until you choose to exit.
